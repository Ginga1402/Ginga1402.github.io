# My Portfolio Website ☀️

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website.
This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a Generative AI Developer & Data Scientist, where I bring together my experience, projects, and skills in building impactful AI solutions.

Feel free to explore my work — from AI projects and professional experience to my skills, education, and achievements — all organized in one place. The portfolio is designed not just as a showcase of what I do, but also as a space to connect and collaborate.

### 🌟 Why I Built This
I created this portfolio to have a single space that represents my professional identity — a place where I can share my journey, achievements, and projects in Generative AI and Data Science. Beyond just being a resume, this website is meant to reflect who I am, what I build, and how I can create impact.

It’s also a platform to connect with like‑minded professionals, collaborators, and organizations who are as passionate about AI, automation, and innovation as I am.
